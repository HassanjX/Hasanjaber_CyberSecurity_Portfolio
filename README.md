## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders representing various aspects of cybersecurity. One of the core sections is:

### `📁 Security Audit`
This folder contains detailed **security audit reports** and related documentation from both academic and personal projects. Each audit includes:

- Scope & objectives
- Tools used (e.g., Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
- Identified vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment
- Remediation recommendations

Each project within this folder follows a consistent structure:
```
